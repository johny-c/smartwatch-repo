This file describe how to make the executable for lcd4linux:

1) Open the File DEPENDENCIES and check if all the packages are installed

2) Using the existing makefile run "make distclean"

3) Enter su-Mode

4) Run "./configure"

5) Run automake

6) run make

Ready ;)

P.S. Please run make the first time as su from Terminal, as Eclipse 
does not run as su, causing the make to fail (some directories must 
be created)
