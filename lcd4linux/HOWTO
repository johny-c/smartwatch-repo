This file describe how to make the executable for lcd4linux:

1) open the File DEPENDENCIES and check if all the packages are installed

2) sudo ./run #Will produce configure-script and makefile, build the program and installs it (the repository's lcd4linux.conf will be used in /etc/)

3) lcd4linux -F

4) As far as there are only small code changes run only
	a) make all
	b) make install
   When doing changes in the conf-File it is recommended to execute the whole run-script because there are several changes in 
   the permissions for the conf-File (see in the run-script)


For cleaning up

1) sudo make uninstall

2) sudo make distclean

3) There are still other files that were created by run but these are ignored in the repository and will be regenerated if there were changes.

Ready ;)

P.S. Please run make the first time as su from Terminal, as Eclipse 
does not run as su, causing the make to fail (some directories must 
be created)
