This file describe how to make the executable for lcd4linux:

1) open the File DEPENDENCIES and check if all the packages are installed

2) using the existing makefile run "make distclean"

3) run as superuser

4) ./configure

5) automake

6) autoconf

7) make

8) make install

9) cp ./lcd4linux.conf /etc/lcd4linux.conf

10) lcd4linux -F [-o <ppm file>]

Ready ;)

P.S. Please run make the first time as su from Terminal, as Eclipse 
does not run as su, causing the make to fail (some directories must 
be created)
